Accelerators should be arranged into a tree.  Lots of keybindings need to be global, but
when it comes to the menu, the lower ones should be hidden until the higher ones are activated
	
	_File / _Open

Alt-O should do nothing in the base state.  When Alt-F is pressed the accelerator group should set

	active_accel = Alt-F (from its collection)

Whilst the menu is active only the accelators below Alt-F should be active.

The mnemonic space gets very cluttered.

The active window determines which accel_group is current.  The app's group is global.

What about dialogs?  Even if they're modeless, they should still have priority over the app.

Aha!  Gnome dialogs have their own accelerator group.

GnomeDialog GtkWindow GtkBin GtkContainer GtkWidget GtkObject
GnomeApp    GtkWindow GtkBin GtkContainer GtkWidget GtkObject

Other dialogs are derived from GtkWindow
should they be derived from GtkDialog, then we could move the accelerators to GtkDialog.

Only dialogs can have menu bars.  So only dialogs need accelerator groups.
