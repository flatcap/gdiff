parse diff files (patch!)

compare a directory tree and a patch file!

check cumulative status for dirs:
	if the dir has only right only -> right
	if the dir has only left  only -> left 
	otherwise just diff
	
separate files and directories?

can hide columns, but not rows
view same, diff, left only, right only
'nothing to view => no directory' option

when not viewing everything, have an option to keep the dir tree intact

split code into parse phase and display phase

two panes? one for dirs (left) and one for files (right/middle)?

configure the colours, sizes, fonts, diff/same/left/right visible, 
tree font and diff font

trap close and Ctrl-C and abort processing loop m_bAbort = TRUE;

diffstat
default single argument to /usr/src/linux (for patches)

[p1]~/src$ diff d diff
diff: diff/d: No such file or directory
if file doesn't exist in directory, see if it's a patch

generate patches

save file list (l/r/s/d/t)

option - show stats -> FULL diff parsed into added 4, deleted 2 moved 15, etc

gnome-history

parse an RCS ,v file and list the revisions -- highlight two and hit 'diff..'
list branches?

if the whole (graphical) tree is encapsulated as a single widget, then it
can be inserted into multiple windows or a single MDI
Also how can I export the widget to another app (embed it) elsewhere?

need to derive a new app class for the menu callbacks
need to derive a diff class (widget) to display the diffs in
