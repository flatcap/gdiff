parse diff files (patch!)

compare a directory tree and a patch file!

check cumulative status for dirs:
	if the dir has only right only -> right
	if the dir has only left  only -> left 
	otherwise just diff
	
separate files and directories?

can hide columns, but not rows
view same, diff, left only, right only
'nothing to view => no directory' option

when not viewing everything, have an option to keep the dir tree intact

split code into parse phase and display phase

two panes? one for dirs (left) and one for files (right/middle)?

configure the colours, sizes, fonts, diff/same/left/right visible, 
tree font and diff font

trap close and Ctrl-C and abort processing loop m_bAbort = TRUE;

diffstat
default single argument to /usr/src/linux (for patches)

[p1]~/src$ diff d diff
diff: diff/d: No such file or directory
if file doesn't exist in directory, see if it's a patch

generate patches

save file list (l/r/s/d/t)
format <, >, ' ', !  space then the filename

option - show stats -> FULL diff parsed into added 4, deleted 2 moved 15, etc

gnome-history

parse an RCS ,v file and list the revisions -- highlight two and hit 'diff..'
list branches?
RCS / CVS view 

if the whole (graphical) tree is encapsulated as a single widget, then it
can be inserted into multiple windows or a single MDI
Also how can I export the widget to another app (embed it) elsewhere?

need to derive a new app class for the menu callbacks
need to derive a diff class (widget) to display the diffs in

if _I_ expand tabs, then I need to keep the original text cached if they change the tabstops

hide rows by regex
each regex has a checkbox to en/disable

HELP!

make the colour scheme a separate .rc file
.gnome-diff	ColourScheme = bob
.gnome-diff_bob	x = red, etc


GtkList and GtkTree can contain widgets, but are limited to 32768 pixels
This could allow me to have my exlusions list with check boxes

the overview wiget:	A click means change the view to one centred HERE
			A drag should send scroll messages to the window (up/down) to match the mouse posn

now that I'm not using a text widget, can I implement highlight / copy
to fit in with editing?

i18n the config files too

pattern matching to locate second file / dir
guess where the root is?

use exclude dialog for extra options

global options
only allow a few to save confusing ourselves.
--ignore-case  Consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.
-w  --ignore-all-space  Ignore all white space.
-b  --ignore-space-change  Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
-B  --ignore-blank-lines  Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.
-I RE  --ignore-matching-lines=RE  Ignore changes whose lines all match RE.
-d  --minimal  Try hard to find a smaller set of changes.
-H  --speed-large-files  Assume large files and many scattered small changes.
-a  --text  Treat all files as text.


-p  --show-c-function  Show which C function each change is in.
could give us tooltips ! won't work for my formatting and
also it truncates the line to 40 chars -- could work it out for myself, though

command line option to specify 'diff' location

diff options (local to one diff, naturally)
	dir dir		compare two directories
	file file	compare two files
	file dir	compare file and dir/file (same name)
	dir file	compare dir/file and file (same name)
	dir		compare dir and .
	file		compare file and . (dir/file (or file is a patch against .))
	l,r x,x		left right extra
	l,x x,l
	r,x x,r
	l   r
	r,l


have two sets of arguments for popt
a 'standard' english set and a customisable 'foreign' set
the english set would always work (but would be hidden)
if locale is english (or sub-dialect) only use english else foreign
how about standard options are long only allow the short options to be i18n'd
implement foreign --help and --usage

implement + - * CTRL, etc for leaves

dependencies

gd_ prefix to avoid clutter

play with libz libgz libbz2 for patch files

patch files -> understanding all the various output formats
of patch (and all combinations)

gnome session management?

right-click menus where applicable
